# XRay shoulder implant images classification using ML/DL techniques -- FILBI project

This project is part of the "FILBI" course in the Bioinformatics MSc program at the University of Bordeaux.
This work was carried out in collaboration with three MSc students.

We used machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify X-ray images of shoulder implants. Our approach included implementing k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a ResNet model.

Our conclusions and results are presented in the report "Conclusion_report.pdf" (in French).
